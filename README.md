# Steps to get project onto phone

## In Git, cloned AndroidStudioProjects: 
 - [https://github.com/adrian2465/AndroidStudioProjects](https://github.com/adrian2465/AndroidStudioProjects)

## To setup project in ADS
 - Installed `Android` and `Android Design Tools`
 - Re-copied Google Drive source to ADS-managed (git) directory, which restored the gradle project files.
 - Created simulator for Samsung Galaxy S23+
 - Updated Android Gradle Project (AGP) per recommendations to 4.2.2 (and then again to 7.4.2) (and then again to 8.4.1)

## For WhenToStartMotor:
 - PROBABLY NOT NEEDED Restored 'app' which had been removed by the Gradle project reload.
 - PROBABLY NOT NEEDED app was removed again during rebuild.  "The IDE modules below were removed by the Gradle project reload: app"
 - Downloaded icons from [https://icon.kitchen](https://icon.kitchen).  NOTE: Did not download round ones.
 - Placed icons onto mipmap in Resource Manager. Overwrite all.

## Installing the App on the phone
### One time setup on Android
 - https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable 
   - Enable Developer Options by tapping Build Number 7 times
   - Under Developer Options, turn on "Stay Awake While Charging"
   - Under Developer Options, enable USB Debugging
 - On Android Studio, under Run Configuration, I checked "Always install for all users" (Not sure I need this)
 - Plug Android into USB port. Click "Allow USB Debugging" 
 - On Android Studio, get QR code provided (under Run -> Select Device -> Pair using WIFI)
 - Not sure I need this: On Samsung, using camera or in WIFI Settings, pair using QR code. Samsung S23+ should appear in Studio as a _physical_ device on which to run.
 - Run it. App is now installed.
 - Probably can disable USB Debugging again afterwards.
